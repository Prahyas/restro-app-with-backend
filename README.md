Project Overview:
A web-based Point of Sale (POS) system developed using React for small to medium-sized restaurants. The system provides features for managing tables, taking orders, online orders, account management, and generating invoices.

Features:

Table Management: The system allows restaurant staff to manage tables by adding, deleting, or updating table information. The table information includes the table number, the number of seats, and the table status.

Order Management: Restaurant staff can take orders from customers using the POS system. They can add, edit or delete orders, view order history, and manage order status. 

Online Ordering: The system allows customers to place orders online. They can choose their desired dishes, add them to the cart, and check out.

Account Management: The system has three types of user accounts: admin, moderators, and users. Admin accounts have access to all system features, while moderators have limited access. Users can view their order history and manage their profile information.

Invoice Generation: The system provides a checkout functionality to generate invoices for completed orders. The system generates a unique invoice number, includes the order details and total amount, and allows for payment processing.
